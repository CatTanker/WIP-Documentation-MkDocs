##Noteworthy Projects:


MadHQ has remade the RA2 Allied and Soviet Campaigns entirely, designed for the vanilla game

Almost Perfect Red Alert 2 (APRA2) is a fan project to produce a Red Alert 2 campaign in Mental Omega.  <br />
The team has made a quantity of high quality work that is publicly available, and consists of quite a few skilled and experienced mappers who can likely offer experience and advice. An excellent benchmark for any modern campaign developers who intend to use a mod's features to a high standard  <br />
