<p>The project started as a list of all rhe relevant mapping resources i have discovered, placed inside my mapping discord server in a dedicated channel. Due to discord's limitations, and a few other factors, I decided it was not wise to lock my first draft of information up in a discord server, and so I added it to github. While gists was also an option, it did not have the complexity and collaboration element that i wanted this project to achieve.</p>
<p>Over time i have worked on the list, adding new entries and improving it's relevance by mentioning areas such as the <a href="https://github.com/Rampastring/WorldAlteringEditor">World Altering Editor</a>.</p>
<p>Since i frequently use linux as a daily driver, and have been since mid 2020, i realised there was relatively little formalised information about running WW 2.5D games on linux. As with most linux users, i broke my build several times, and as a result got tired of having to dig out the same information each time in order to make a game somewhat run through trial and error. In 2023 i started my writeup, and as of October i pushed my first edition of my linux guide. I have since worked on expanding and simplifying the guide into the product that it is today.</p>
<p>After suggestions to move to ReadTheDocs i finally took on this task in December 2023, and a month on i have finished the transition, meaning all materials are now re-formated and are on this web page.</p>
<p>I hope you find the spectrum of information available to be useful.</p>
<h2 id="credits-and-contributions">Credits and Contributions</h2>
<p>While this is a solo project by myself (CatTanker), i am always up for collaboration if anyone wisahes to expand and contribute to this guide.
I also need to provide a special thanks to:
- Kerbiter, for technical support and suggestions.
- Doomguy, moral support.
- Lylak and AlliedG for suggesting that i improve the guide when it was in my discord server.
- The developers of tools and resources linked, who without this project would be pointless</p>
<p>If you wish to have any input, you can reach me in most major CnC discords, and you can head to <a href="https://github.com/CatTanker/cnc_map_tool_guide">this project's github page</a></p>
